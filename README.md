===

### Instructions

* Unzip Project_Two_Submission.zip in an empty directory on FLIP  
* Navigate to that directory
* Type the following command:

```
tar -xvf cs325_Group12_ProjectTwo.tar.bz2
```

* You should see the following directories/files:

  * ./divide-conquer/changeslow.py   -Contains python code for the 'changeslow' algorithm
  * ./greedy/changegreedy.py  -Contains python code for the 'greedy' algorithm
  * ./dynamic-programming/changedp.py   -Contains python code for the 'dynamic programming' algorithm
  * ./run-files/projectTwo.py   -Contains python code to run inputs through algorithms and Also runs tests and experimental analysis (commented out)
  * ./Coin1.txt   -Contains input to test the algorithms with
  * ./Coin1change.txt   -Contains the observed output when passing in Coin1.txt to projectTwo.py
  * ./Amount.txt  -Contains more inputs to test algorithms against
  * ./Amountchange.txt  -Contains the output when passing in Amount.txt to projectTwo.py
* Navigate to the "run-files" directory
* Type the following command to run the code and produce your own copy of the 'Amountchange.txt': 

```
./runProjectTwo.sh
```

* You can then check the results from running the script in the newly created 'Amountchange.txt' in the current directory
