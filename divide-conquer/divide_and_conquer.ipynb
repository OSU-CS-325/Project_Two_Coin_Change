The tricky piece is that $n$ is non-uniform - meaning the subproblem sizes and number vary from 1 to $n-1$.  In reality the for-loop simply \"groups\" the recursive calls into sets of two.  The worst-case number of recursive calls for a given value of $n$ is linear with $n$.\n",

By definition the sub-problem sizes will decline as we descend deeper into the recursion - but how quickly?  The larger $k$ is relative to $n$ the more likely that coinArray cointains $n$ and the more quickly the solution will be reached.  The opposite also applies.\n",
