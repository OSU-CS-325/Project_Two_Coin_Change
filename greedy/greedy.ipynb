The parameter change is the amount of change that needs to be composed of various combinations of coins that are denoted in the coinArray. From this point forward we will refer to the length of the coinArray as $k$ and the value for change as $n$."

If a given coin is too large to be subtracted from the remaining change, then the next lower coin is attempted.
