The parameter change is the amount of change that needs to be composed of various combinations of coins that are denoted in the coinArray. From this point forward we will refer to the length of the coinArray as $k$ and the value for change as $n$."

    "As can be seen from the pseudo-code above we first start with a for-loop that iterates from $0$ to $n$. Each change value between $0$ and $n$ are then checked against the each denomination in the coinArray as can be seen in the inner for loop where the values are from $0$ to $k$ in the worst case because if the change amount is less than any coin denominations within the coinArray those coin denomination(s) are skipped in the loop. Therefore this portion of the algorithm will have a runtime of $O(n * k)$. The next for loop creates the min_used array and sets it to a length $k$. After that there is a while loop that runs similarly to the first nested for loop so it also will have a runtime of $O(n * k)$. The various variable assignments and index look-ups for the arrays within the method all will have $O(1)$. This leaves us with a runtime of:\n",

    "Where the constant term $2$ drops off as well as the $O(1)$ term because the $O(n * k)$ will dominate as $n$ becomes increasingly large. Therefore the finalized runtime of the dynamic programming change making algorithm is:\n",
