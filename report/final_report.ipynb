    "As we can see in the plots above the best fitting curves are linear for the greedy and dynamic programming cases and exponential for the slow case. The trends observed by the fit lines match what we would expect from our runtime analysis whereby the greedy has a theoretical runtime of $O(n + k)$, the dp has a theoretical runtime of $O(n * k)$ and the slow has a theoretical runtime of $O(3^{n})$. The greedy and dynamic programming runtimes are observed to be linear because $k$ (length of the coin denominations array) is held constant while $n$ (the change amount) is varying, therefore the experimental curves are still consistent the theoretical runtimes. In Question 5, the curve fit of the slow algorithm is slightly degraded by the fact that all even values of $A$ bypass the exponential behavior due to the change being made in a single coin. This is evident by the run time for even values of $A$ being approximately 0. If a curve fit was drawn through the odd values of $A$, it would match the behavior from Q3/Q4a/Q4b."

Secondly, a larger value of A only changes the plot in that it changes the slope of the DP curve.  The effect on the greedy curve is minimal, especially for larger values of A, because it starts to dominate over len(V).  One such plot with fixed value A=100 is shown below."

Increasing A to a higher value was uneccessary to understanding how the slowchange algorithm responds to increasing size of coin array V.  The plot below shows that the slowchange algorithm is actually worst for the smallest size of V and dramatically and quickly improves as size of V increases. This behavior is due to the fact that as the size of V increases, the number of base cases increases. The base cases allow the algorithm to terminate without entering further recursive calls. In the case where V = [1], the recursion must run all the way to the bottom. In essence, adding elements to V decreases the \"full-ness\" of the recursion tree."
